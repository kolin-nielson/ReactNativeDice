# Gambling Bank App

A modern, professional-looking mobile application built with React Native and Expo that simulates a gambling bank. Users can place bets, view their current balance, and check a live-updating betting historyâ€”all within a sleek, well-designed UI.

## Overview

The Gambling Bank App allows users to:
- View their current bank balance.
- Place bets on a dice game using a customizable target and bet amount.
- Receive instant feedback (via Toast notifications and on-screen messages) about the outcome of each bet.
- See a live, scrollable betting history that updates in real-time.

The app leverages modern state management and navigation techniques to provide a seamless experience across multiple screens.
